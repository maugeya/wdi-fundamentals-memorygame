			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso, or Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid facedown on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

			<h2>Why play?</h2>
			<p>Memory games can help us to pass the time and socialise but can also help to better our personal wellbeing. Memory games can help to exercise the brain. They can help in preventing memory-related illnesses such as Alzheimer's. They also help to improve concentration, cognitive skills, focus and reasoning skills.</p>
